<h1 id="warning">WARNING!</h1>
<p>This application implements a notebook interface which allows execution
of arbitrary JavaScript code from the notebooks it loads.  If you receive
a notebook from an unknown or untrusted source and load and evaluate it,
you will be excuting JavaScript code from that source.  Beware.</p>

<p>The notebook is constructed from a series of Interaction Elements.
Each Interaction Element (ie) is divided into an <em>input</em> and, below,
an <em>output</em>.</p>

<h2 id="expression-evaluation">Expression Evaluation</h2>
<p>Within an expression, the &quot;this&quot; object references the eval_state
object of the notebook.  This object persists until the notebook
is opened to a new file or is cleared, at which point it is reset
to an empty object {}.</p>
<p>During evaluation, this.eval_context references an object whose
properties are available directly for evaluation within any
interaction element, without the need to prefix them with any parent
object.  In this sense, this.eval_context acts like a global
environment for the notebook without the need to modify globalThis.</p>
<p>vars(...objects) assigns new properties to this.eval_context.
Those properties then become available &quot;globally&quot;.  Note that the
&quot;global&quot; objects are available from any interaction element, that
is until the notebook is opened to a new file or is cleared.
The return value is undefined; this makes ${vars(...)} in a
template literal (and in markup) not insert anything into the output.</p>
<p>Other properties set on the &quot;this&quot; object, like the &quot;global&quot;
properties, persist until the notebook is opened to a new file or
is cleared.  However, those properties must be prefixed by &quot;this.&quot;
to reference them.</p>
<p>A return statement within an interaction element terminates the
evaluation and the value of the return statement becomes the result
of the evaluation, and that result will be output.</p>
<h3 id="ephemeral-eval_context">Ephemeral eval_context</h3>
<p>During evaluation, a number of other values are available &quot;globally&quot;,
though these values do not persist after the particular evaluation
(except for references from async code started during the evaluation).
These values include output_context (which provides utilities for
manipulation of the output of the interaction element), various
mathematics interfaces, and various graphics functions and other
functions to manipluate the output.  Also included are:</p>
<pre><code>settings:               current settings
theme_settings:         current theme_settings
set_formatting_options: set displayAlign and displayIndent
import_lib:             import other libraries from the lib/ directory
vars:                   export new &quot;global&quot; properties
is_stopped:             determine if the evaluation has been stopped
delay_ms:               return a Promise that resolves after a specified delay
</code></pre>
<p>These all continue to be available even after the evaluation has
returned if there are any async actions still active.
