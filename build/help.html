<h1 id="stucture-of-the-notebook">Stucture of the Notebook</h1>
<p>The notebook is constructed from a series of Interaction Elements.
Each Interaction Element (ie) is divided into an <em>input</em> and, below,
an <em>output</em>.</p>
<h1 id="interaction-elements">Interaction Elements</h1>

<h2 id="expression-evaluation">Expression Evaluation</h2>
<p>Within an expression, the &quot;this&quot; object references the eval_state
object of the notebook.  This object persists until the notebook
is opened to a new file or is cleared, at which point it is reset
to an empty object {}.</p>
<p>During evaluation, this.eval_context references an object whose
properties are available directly for evaluation within any
interaction element, without the need to prefix them with any parent
object.  In this sense, this.eval_context acts like a global
environment for the notebook without the need to modify globalThis.</p>
<p>global_export(...objects) assigns new properties to this.eval_context.
Those properties then become available &quot;globally&quot;.  Note that the
&quot;global&quot; objects are available from any interaction element, that
is until the notebook is opened to a new file or is cleared.</p>
<p>Other properties set on the &quot;this&quot; object, like the &quot;global&quot;
properties, persist until the notebook is opened to a new file or
is cleared.  However, those properties must be prefixed by &quot;this.&quot;
to reference them.</p>
<p>A return statement within an interaction element terminates the
evaluation and the value of the return statement becomes the result
of the evaluation, and that result will be output.</p>
<h3 id="ephemeral-eval_context">Ephemeral eval_context</h3>
<p>During evaluation, a number of other values are available &quot;globally&quot;,
though these values do not persist after the particular evaluation
(except for references from async code started during the evaluation).
These values include output_context (which provides utilities for
manipulation of the output of the interaction element), various
mathematics interfaces, and various graphics functions and other
functions to manipluate the output.  Also included are:</p>
<pre><code>import_lib:    import other libraries from the lib/ directory
global_export: export new &quot;global&quot; properties
is_stopped:    determine if the evaluation has been stopped
</code></pre>
<p>These all continue to be available even after the evaluation has
returned if there are any async actions still active.
See the method _create_ephemeral_eval_context().</p>
