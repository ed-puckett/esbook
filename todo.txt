exported dagre svg from an html-embedded server has arrowheads but default fill and stroke colors are transparent (style apparently not found and not embedded)
emacs key bindings shadow other important standard key bindings (e.g., Ctrl-X)
call cleanup on change objects that are deleted
coalesce "empty" changes to output (Change)
provide "toast" messages + dialog to display past messages
update theme-colors (dark/light modes)
system dark/light mode switch is not detected (chromium bug on gnome/linux)

documentation: update and improve help
documentation: interaction with SVG elements (SHIFT-scroll to zoom, etc)
documentation: warning about executable content
documentation: export, also ?s= parameter

review Content-Security-Policy
set width on graphics output DIVs
sometimes input cell does not respond to keyboard shortcuts after focus is reset (with mouse?) (focus issues?)
review setting of focus overall (many places use setTimeout() to defer setting of focus, somewhat kludgey)
provide "clear" action for current output or all outputs
provide fallback for file open/save interfaces (when on non-chromium browsers)
provide recent file interface

delete_element should clear the element if there is only one element


=== THINK ABOUT ===
settings update broadcast to other instances (polling?)
provide options when doing export (e.g., clear outputs)
more extensively support Change for output
enable api to perform operations programmatically (e.g., eval-notebook)
re-install @yaffle/expression when it is more "distributable"
add Algebite and Mathjs
save to MIME format (multipart/mixed) to allow easy editing (issue: UTF-8) (see https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html )
implement auto-hide for autoeval ie and dynamically change when its input element is modified (maybe not?)
keep "autoeval"?
use "contenteditable" element instead of CodeMirror stuff?
figure out what to do with nb_state
figure out how to reload / re-initialize eval state
figure out codemirror + emacs clipboard support
deleting element with an eval worker running something like setInterval(): old eval worker keeps running even though "stopped" (maybe on_stopped event could help)
provide on_stopped event to allow cleanup of background "processes" (e.g., setInterval)


=== UNREPEATED BUGS ====
investigate: seems like files are being reloaded a lot as elements are evaluated
pythagorean-triples.esbook: first cell lines are concatenated (saw once, but not again...)
have witnessed stray text in buffers after copying/pasting/evaluating (accidental scroll wheel paste?)


=== DONE ===
* provide keyboard navigation into and out of input areas
* menus: provide way to activate menu from keyboard (including TAB navigation to menu)
* preview images in saved notebooks that have been opened should cause a line break before next element (set examples/many-ecas.esbook)
* output-context.js: create_svg_output_data() hard-codes css selector 'svg.dagre'
* dagre: no arrow heads displayed in saved rendered image
* when loading, menus flash briefly as unformatted <ul>s before turning into menus
* first ie is initially too tall and has extraneous scroll bar
* defer loading of code until used for graphics output-handlers (e.g., plotly)
* menus: allow cross-navigation without going all the way to the top of the current menu
* menus: position submenus when opening
* menus: enable/disable menu items based on notebook state
* menus: add keyboard navigation
* menus: adjust order of modified keys in display of keyboard equivalent
* key-spec.js: key_spec_to_glyphs: is_on_macos_result not implemented (removed)
* menus: show keyboard equivalents using glyphs
* provide menus (basic functionality)
* make whether opening or importing more apparent (in file open dialog)
* file open/save dialog does not use the "suggested" filename or extensions (seems to be a deficiency of ShowSaveFilePicker)
* cannot receive click events on things like button elements in the output portion of an ie (problem: redirecting click focus from output to input)
* examples/cmjs-demo.esbook: output of count tree and of node graph are clipped and not positioned well
* notebook.js: send_tab_state_to_parent_processes: rename to something more appropriate (re-appropriated update_global_view_properties)
* provide feedback when saving and provide visible modified indicator
* need to check graphics output
* notebook imported from html embedded data starts out with modified indicator active (and yet can exit page without warning)
* not prompting user when leaving a modified page
* provide status bar (modified status, eval running, help link, ...)
* provide help link
* save/export to a loadable web page instead of a separate document format
* bundle code instead of loading out of node_modules
* dagre: edges not rendered in image_uri
* svg elements are not displayed wide enough, both in the saved image form and the rendered form (see examples/cmjs-demo.esbook)
* use Shift-ENTER for eval and Ctrl-ENTER for eval-and-stay
* make global_export not modify globalThis
* https://github.com/Yaffle/Expression / https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yaffle/expression
* canvas2d image_uri not being rendered for persistent state
* need a way to easily define variables that are visible in subsequent interaction elements
* fix loading of old facet code in examples
* markdown processing: html tags in markdown trip up the display of the element
* markdown processing: code blocks have extraneous stuff at beginning: <span class="MathJax_Preview" ... (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62111699/mathjax-strangely-render-back-tick-in-code-blocks )
* [no longer relevant] make facet scripts inline-able without having been loaded via facet() [need to have one single export handler that listens for any facet export or error event]
* update facet mechanism to use ES6 modules
* settings dialog is partially hidden by event blocker element (first time only?)
* Ctrl-, can bring up multiple settings dialogs (if a settings dialog is already showing)
* implement settings dialog
* notebook.js: update_cm_from_settings(cm, ie): not defined: bind_key_handler, remove_current_key_handler
* too many questions when saving
* message_controller: provide better handling of scrolling and focus
* keyboard handling / key bindings
* notebook / notebook state
* integrate key-handler.js into key-bindings.js
* set up html for notebook during initialization
* set up css for notebook during initialization
* load codemirror
* implement esbook mode for codemirror
* reimplement stuff that uses ipcRenderer
* implement eval
* support opening/saving notebooks
* open: prompts for saving (!)
* implement interface to IndexedDB
* provide settings persistence (through IndexedDB)
* set up "recents" (through IndexedDB)
* confirm close
* switch codemirror mode based on input type (md+mj or javascript)
* update ie class according to text/code mode (watch 'change' events that affect line 1)
* move to different ie with keyboard does not set focus correctly
* implement auto-hide for non-expression inputs
* implement message_controller.confirm_sync (eliminated the need for _sync variant...)
* update output-handlers.js
* update class OutputContext in notebook.js
* update eval-worker.js
* save failed: get_fs_stats_for_file_handle is not defined
* eval: graphics element is not sized correctly (see examples/dagre-demo.esbook)
* streamline operation of output handlers
* provide interface in eval for creating output elements, etc
* eval: provide access to output_context
* make eval_fn "this" be a persistent context for the notebook
* reset the persistent context for the notebook when resetting evaluation
* add an api for creating CanvasRendering2DContext/Element
* definable notebook init script (to be run when notebook is loaded) (autoeval)
* don't load scripts more that once: load_script(), load_script_and_wait_for_condition()
